# Dockerfile is a text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image.

# To build a Docker image, you need to create a Dockerfile with the following syntax:
# docker build -t [image name]:[tag] .
# -t : Tag
# [image name] : Name of the image
# [tag] : Version of the image. If you don't specify a tag, Docker will use the latest tag by default.
# . : Directory where the Dockerfile is located. It will build the image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. You can also specify the Absolute path.

# FROM : This is the base image that you want to use for your application. If you don't specify a tag, Docker will use the latest tag by default.
# FROM [image name]
FROM openjdk:17-jdk

# docker container will be finished if there is no process running in the container.
# So, to debug a container which was not started, add the following command to this Dockerfile:
# stop system for 300 seconds
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 300"]
